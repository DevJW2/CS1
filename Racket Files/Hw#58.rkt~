Structuring questions for recursive problems
0  structure of the problem
---------------------------
0a. What problem are you asked to solve?
    and What does "size" mean in the context of that problem?
Calculates the number of moves required to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle for
a given number of disks.
size = number of disks 

0b. What samples will test the procedure and what answers are
    required? You must know the expected answers, and tests
    should be the smallest useful ones.
The base case
one disk should return one move
two disks should return three moves
three disks should return seven moves

0c. What information do you have to be told?
    That is, what information has to be supplied as parameters?
Answer: amount of disks


0d. What is the structure of the answer you will produce?
    That is, what will your function produce?
    A number? An integer? A Boolean? A list?
Answer: a number 


1   structure of the recursive solution
---------------------------------------
1a. What problem can Mr. Brooks solve? Use your answers to 0a 
    to describe the same problem, except smaller in size,
    according to your meaning for "size".
The recursive sub-call will solve the amount of moves it takes for disk - 1

1b. What sub-problem will you ask Mr. Brooks to solve? and
    How will you use Mr. Brooks's answer to construct your own?
The recursive sub-call will solve the amount of moves it takes for disk-1
and adding 1 to it. 

2  structure of the base case solution
--------------------------------------
2a.  What is the base case? Start with the problem of size 0.
     If that size has a solution that cannot be considered wrong,
     use that size as the base case. Otherwise, consider the
     next size up until you have an answer.
The base case would be 0 

2b.  How can you solve the base case for this problem?
return the base case
